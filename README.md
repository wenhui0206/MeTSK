# Generalizable Representation Learning for fMRI-based Neurological Disorder Identification

This repository contains the official implementation of **MeTSK**, a generalizable representation learning framework designed specifically for neurological disorder identification using functional MRI (fMRI) data.

## Overview

MeTSK combines **Meta-learning** and **Self-supervised learning** to tackle challenges posed by scarce and heterogeneous clinical fMRI datasets. Our method achieves robust representation learning and significantly improves model generalization to unseen clinical data.
